#### SpinelHullDistances.json

Contains distance to formation energy convex hull for all compounds calculated across all runs. Energies are adjusted according to Materials Project compatibility requirements. Energies represent the lower energy state between normal and proxy-orderered inverse comfiguration for each stoichiometry.
